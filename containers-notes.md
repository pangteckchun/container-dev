### Virtualization Fundamentals ###
1. These 3 linux OS based features are the building blocks of modern day containerisation. They have existed on a long time (> 20 years) as `OS Level Virtualization` techniques but only recent times did these features become more enriched that they are adapted for containers.  

1. The 3 most important features are `cgroups`, `namespaces` & `UnionFS`.

1. `cgroups` allow the limitation of memory, disk I/O, and network usage for a group of processes.  
In addition, cgroups may set usage quotas, and prioritize a process group to receive more CPU time or memory than other groups.  
Also, a group's resource usage can be measured for accounting and billing purposes, and its state can be controlled by freezing and restarting the group.

1. `Namespaces` may limit the visibility of cgroups, hostname, process IDs, IPC mechanisms, network interfaces and routes, users, and mounted file systems. To an isolated process running inside a namespace, a namespaced resource, such as the network, will appear as the process' own dedicated resource. Processes running inside a namespace are aware of any changes in the local namespaced system resources, however, such changes will not be visible to other processes or other namespaces.  
`Namespaces` isolate processes from one container to prevent them from modifying the hostname, network interfaces, or mounts for processes running in other containers. The processes isolated inside a container can only see system resources namespaced for that particular container. 

1. `UnionFS` allows the overlay of separate transparent file systems to produce an virtual single unified file system.
Several file systems, called branches, are virtually stacked, their contents appear to be merged, however, physically, they remain separate.  
The real physical separation, together with read-only and read-write access modes, help to prevent data corruption with the implementation of a `Copy-on-Write (CoW)` mechanism.  
`UniionFS` allows container images to be made at runtime, using heavy file linkages to main base image s source while allowing changes to be made to read writable file system.

### Virtualization 101 ###
1. Operating system-level virtualization is a kernel's capability to allow creation and existence of multiple isolated environments, such as containers, on the same hosts, without a need to install a guest OS (unlike a full VM)

1. These containers or virtalizaed environments are limited by the kernel to its assigned devices. This separation allows programs to run in ther own assigned virual environment for better security and resource management.

1. It leverages a `CoW` mechanism type of stacked storage management model, shared by all containers.

1. Mechanisms implementing OS level virtualization are `chroot` (one of the oldest), `LXC` (Linux Containers), `Systemd-nspwan`

1. `chroot` - changing the root directory of a process and its children, to a virtual root, giving the impression the process has the real root directory of he OS, without the possibiliy of escaping to access the real root directory.

1. `LXC` introduced in 2008 on Linux systems. Leverages cgroups and chroot, with namespace isolation to limit resources and isolate from host OS.

1. `Systemd-nspawn` introdued in 2010 in Linux systems. Fully virtualize process tree, fiesystem, users, host and domain name. Processes cannot communicate aceoss containers. May run system services managed by `systemd`.

### Container Standards & Runtimes ###
1. Containers - allows shipping of application code along with its dependencies all packaged in a box, with a standard to "unbox" and execute it in different isolated environments. This ensures maximum portability and flexibility for quick feedback loop for code-to-deploy demands.

1. Standardization amongst containers frameworks and runtimes, has been lacking. Evolved now into 2 common standards: App Container (`appc`) and Open Container Initiative (`OCI`). Gradual convergence from App Container --> Open Container Initiative.

#### `appc` ####
1. Introduced in 2014 by CoreOS, Google and Redhat.

1. Defines its own Application Container Image (`ACI`) format for container images.

1. `appc` aims to speed up design and deployment of containers while ensuring integrity through crypto signatures.

1. Provides the following aspects to manage the container lfecycle:
- App Container Image (`ACI`)
- App Container Image Discovery
- App Conainer Pod
- App Container Executor (`ACE`)

#### `OCI` ####
1. Introduced in 2015 by Docker and other leaders.

1. `OCI` provides the following aspects:
- **Runtime Specification** -  defines how to run a container bundle that is unpacked on disk.
- **Image Format Specification** - defines the OCI Image Format that includes a manifest, a set of filesytem layers, a config file and an optional image index.

### Container Runtimes ###
1. Fundamentals: Container runtimes are responsible to provide an environment supporting basic operations with images and the running containers, that is both configurable and consistent;  
Regardless of the underlying infrastructure - whether an on-prem Data Center or a Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), containersâ€™ behavior is expected to be the same, thus allowing users to develop and test containers on any system across all tiers - from development to production.

1. Different container runtimes:
- `runc` - limited capabilities.
- `containerd` - designed to run as en embedded daemon of a more robust container management system; not used directy by end users; used in Docker engine, Kubernetes, GKE etc; utilizes `runc`. Open-sourced by Docker
- `Docker` - most robust but also complex. Uses `LXC` initially as its runtime but has developed and open-sourced `libcontainer` to replace `LXC`. Leverages   
See architecture:  
-- **Docker client** - CLI tool; runs docker commands against a Docker daemon host.  
-- **Docker host** - `dockerd` responsible for building, running, and distributing Docker containers. A daemon can act alone, or interact with other daemons to manage distributed Docker services across multiple Docker hosts clustered together. It listens for Docker API requests from the Docker client and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.  
-- **Docker registries** - popular public ones: Docker Hub, quay (K8S). Can be private and self hosted too.  
-- **Latest - Docker Desktop** - all in one installer for all docker components.
- `rkt` - developed by CoreOS; implements the `appc` specification. Interoperable with Docker Hub and docker based images. No longer maintained by Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
- `CRI-O` - a lightweight alternative to using Docker or rkt as the runtimes for Kubernetes. The CRI-O runtime has been optimized for Kubernetes. CRI-O also supports container security. Not intended to be used by end-users too, like `containerd`.

### Image operations ###
1. **Container image** - when loaded at runtime, a containr is a running instance of an image; many containers maybes started from the same image.

1. Image are stored in layered using `CoW` mechanism. Base image are stored at the bottom referenced by layered images on top which would contain different features for different container runtime needed.

1. Image registry - efficent and secure storage. Reusability of images.

1. Container image operations alow users to manage image lifecycle from creation to registry storage, prep for running as container.  
- Docker uses a `Dockerfile` - which contains a set of instructions for dockerd to build an image. Use `docker image build` or `docker builder build` to build an image (traditional method uses `docker build`.

1. NOTE: Pulling an image from say Docker Registry, using e.g. `docker image pull` only downloads the image to the local disk (local repo). It is just a container image; NOT YET a running container. See next section on how to create a container from an image downloaded.

---

### Container operations ###
1. `docker` - modern docker commands group their tradiional methods based on these 4 context: *container,image, engine, system*. E.g. `docker image pull` versus `docker pull`; the old methods will be deprecated gradually.

1. Use `docker commit` to build an image from a container and its most recent configuration.

1. `rkt` operates on pods rather than containers. E.g. `rkt run` run a pod from a container image.

1. `podman` has very similar command syntax to docker. It is capable of managing containers, pods, container images both OCI-based and Docker-based. In addition to container image operations, Podman supports operations to manage the entire lifecycle of a container.

#### `docker` container opertions ####
1. Creating a container from an image - `docker container create -it [some image name downloaded to local repo]`; this command only creates the container but does not start it.

1. Start the container using - `docker container start [partial container ID]`.

1. Hostname of container by default is the container ID.

1. Inspect details of container using `docker container inspect [partial container ID]`.
